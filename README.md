### Information

I forked the original repo of : [aaronjensen](https://github.com/aaronjensen/vimfiles)
There is only a few changes, thank him for that great simple configuration!

### Installation

`git clone git://github.com/elbouillon/vimfiles.git ~/.vim && ~/.vim/setup.sh`

You can also install `fonts/Inconsolata-g-Powerline.ttf` if you want fancy powerline symbols. If not you may want to disable fancy in your `.vimrc.local`.

Switched the Ack plugin to use [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
Install OSX: `brew install the_silver_searcher`

For xmpfilter:

```
$ gem install rcodetools fastri
```

Uses a different [matcher for
ctrlp](https://github.com/JazzCore/ctrlp-cmatcher) that is written in C. The
`setup.sh` will build it, but you should have `python-dev` installed if you do
not.
